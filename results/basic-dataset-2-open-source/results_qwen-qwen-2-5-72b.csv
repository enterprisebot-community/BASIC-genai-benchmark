We may ask you to provide more information to support your claim, for example your card receipt or a copy of your statement. You must provide us with the information we ask for as soon as reasonably possible so that we can assess your claim. We will pay you for the cost of the treatment we cover. If it turns out that your treatment or part of it is not covered, we will not reimburse you for the cost of the treatment that is not covered. What happens if I receive a bill?

3,Does AXA cover pre-existing conditions?,"AXA Healthcare covers pre-existing conditions based on the underwriting terms you joined on, which include fully underwritten, continuing medical exclusions, or moratorium","To check whether we will agree to cover a treatment, please call us on +44 (0)1892 503 856 before you start treatment 3.2 > How your policy works with pre-existing conditions and symptoms of them Your policy is designed to cover treatment of new medical conditions that begin after you join. You may also be covered for treatment of conditions you were aware of or had already had when you joined. We call these conditions pre-existing conditions. Your cover for pre-existing conditions depends on the underwriting terms you joined on. Your healthcare insurance statement shows which underwriting terms you joined on. Here are the options: • Fully underwritten (or full medical underwriting) • Continuing medical exclusions • Moratorium. Page 23 Definition of a pre-existing condition A pre-existing condition is any disease, illness or injury that: • you have received medication, advice or treatment for in the five years before the start of your cover, or • you have experienced symptoms of in the five years before the start of your cover, whether or not the condition was diagnosed. Underwriting terms We have explained how each set of underwriting terms work and what cover you have for pre-existing conditions in the following panels. If you are unsure about your cover for treatment of pre-existing conditions, it is always best to contact us. Definition of fully underwritten or full medical underwriting ‘Fully underwritten’ means we asked you for details of your medical history, including any pre-existing conditions, before you joined. We then worked out your cover based on the information we received. We list any special terms or exclusions on your healthcare insurance statement – please check this carefully. For example, you may not have cover for something specific if you have had that condition in the past. Your statement will also show whether we can remove the exclusion after a period of time. Definition of continuing medical exclusions If you joined us on ‘continuing medical exclusions’ terms, we are carrying on your exclusions for medical conditions from your previous health insurer. This normally means we only asked you a few brief medical questions. We listed any special terms or exclusions on your healthcare insurance statement – please check this carefully. For example, you may not have cover for something specific if you have had that condition in the past. Your healthcare insurance statement will also show whether we will remove the exclusion after a period of time. If we carried on a moratorium from your previous healthcare insurance, the rules of your moratorium may be slightly different, and we may start the moratorium from when it originally began on your previous insurance. Your healthcare insurance statement will show when your moratorium started. Definition of moratorium If you joined us on moratorium terms, it means that you do not have cover for treatment of medical problems you had in the five years before you joined us until: • you have been a member for two years in a row, and • you have had a period of two years in a row that have been trouble-free from that condition. If you joined us from another health insurer or from a company plan, and we carried on your moratorium from that insurer, the rules may be slightly different, and we may start the moratorium from when it originally began on your previous insurance. If you joined on moratorium terms, what do we mean by trouble-free? Trouble-free means that, for the medical condition you need treatment for, you have not: Page 24 • had a medical opinion from a medical practitioner • taken medication (including over-the-counter drugs) • followed a special diet • had medical treatment • visited a medical practitioner, complementary practitioner, optician or dentist.

13,Does AXA offer international health insurance coverage?,"AXA provides international health insurance coverage, offering access to a range of services for eligible conditions, diagnostics, treatments, and emergency evacuation and repatriation","Employees who have ongoing or recent medical symptoms, whether they have seen a doctor or been diagnosed with a specific condition or not, are unlikely to be able to use this product to receive private treatment for those symptoms. What are the key value elements/ characteristics of the product that are important for the target market (including notable exclusions)? These comprehensive private health insurance products provide customers with access to a range of services for eligible conditions, diagnostics and treatments including: • In-patient and day patient treatment; • Surgical out-patient treatment; • Cancer treatment; • Access to healthcare experts; and • Emergency evacuation and repatriation. A fully comprehensive private international health insurance product may be out of reach for many, so these products offer choice and affordability through offering several levels of cover. Customers can select from a range of plans to fit their needs with benefits, including: • Specialist consultations and diagnostic tests as an out-patient; • Out-patient therapies e.g. physiotherapist; • Complementary practitioner charges; • New chronic conditions; • Mental health treatments; • Pregnancy and childbirth cover; • Annual health checks; • Optical cover; • Dental treatment; and • Travel Insurance. Depending on the plan level selected customers can also choose the option to include: • Increased out-patient benefits; • Increased dental benefits; and • Travel Insurance. Customers can also tailor benefits to meet their needs and goals by making changes to how the plan responds in the event of a claim by choosing from a range of excess options. This option could potentially be used by the target market to mitigate short term financial vulnerability. Page 4 Does the product include optional covers? Plan cover will vary based on option selected. How should this product be distributed? The distribution strategy is considered appropriate for the target market with customers having the option to purchase direct from AXA – Global Healthcare or a private health insurance specialist intermediary of their choice.

Commission, fees, or charges passed onto the customer must be proportionate to the service provided and provide fair value. How can the product be sold? Can it be sold without advice? We would suggest that this product can be sold face to face or via telephone. This product can be sold with or without advice depending on your preference and in line with FCA regulations.

14,How does AXA's prescription drug coverage work?,"Prescription drugs covered by AXA are paid for by the policy if prescribed by a medical practitioner and are part of the medical treatment covered by the policy. Providers may ask for payment upfront, and you can claim the cost back from AXA","Paying claims for in-patient and day-patient treatment at a hospital where we have arrangements for making direct payments If you have your treatment at a hospital listed in our network of hospitals, we will pay the hospital directly for treatment covered by your policy. Always remember to contact us before you have your treatment so that we can set up any direct payment arrangements with the hospital before your visit. Paying claims for in-patient and day-patient treatment at other hospitals If you have treatment that you are covered for at a hospital that is not in our network of hospitals, we may still be able to pay the hospital directly. Always remember to contact us before you have your treatment so that we can get in touch with the hospital you’ve chosen and try to arrange to pay them directly for your treatment. Paying claims for out-patient treatment If you have out-patient treatment, most providers will ask you to pay for your treatment and then make your claim to us. However, some providers will allow you to have your out-patient treatment on the understanding that they will claim the cost back from us. You can search for an out-patient provider at: ​axaglobalhealthcare.com/customer​. You may be asked to show your AXA membership card and a separate form of photo ID when you have your treatment. The treatments that we will cover directly at certain medical providers are: • GP/family doctor consultations • specialist consultations • prescription drugs and dressings • minor diagnostic tests, for example x-rays or ultrasounds • blood tests • up to the first five sessions of physiotherapy (you will need to ask us to pre-approve further sessions) • vaccinations. If it turns out that your treatment is not covered, you will be asked to pay for the cost of the treatment. Page 19 How should I claim if I have already paid for my treatment? If you want to claim for medical bills you have paid yourself, you must make your claim within six months of the date of payment unless that is not reasonably possible. Please contact us on the claims number or at ​axaglobalhealthcare.com/customer​ and we will explain how to claim. If you pay for any treatment yourself, always get a fully receipted invoice that shows how much you have paid for the treatment. You will need this if you want to claim, and for your own records. If your treatment is being provided as part of a package, we will reimburse the cost of the package once all treatment has taken place. If your treatment provider is able to provide a breakdown of the treatment you have received to date, we may be able to reimburse some of the costs before the package of treatment is complete. We may ask you to provide more information to support your claim, for example your card receipt or a copy of your statement. You must provide us with the information we ask for as soon as reasonably possible so that we can assess your claim. We will pay you for the cost of the treatment we cover. If it turns out that your treatment or part of it is not covered, we will not reimburse you for the cost of the treatment that is not covered. What happens if I receive a bill? If you receive a bill, please contact us on the claims number or at ​axaglobalhealthcare.com/customer​ We’ll explain how to send the bill to us so that we can assess it.

We will pay you in the currency that you request when you make a claim. The currency must be in our list of currencies we can pay in. To see the list, go to the ‘How bills are paid’ page on ​axaglobalhealthcare.com​ We will use the exchange rate listed in the Financial Times Guide to World Currencies on the day of your treatment for out-patient and day-patient treatment, and the day of your admission for in-patient treatment. Where there are currency or exchange rate controls in place, we may not use the rate listed in the Financial Times. In these circumstances, we may contact you to request evidence of the exchange rate used when you purchased the currency and we will use that exchange rate to reimburse you. Charges from your bank You should contact your own bank to find out if they will make any charges for you to send or receive money, or to exchange currency. Any charges from your bank are not covered by your policy. 2.2 > The information we may need when you make a claim When you call us, we will explain if your treatment is covered.

This includes if there’s a change in your country of residence or domicile country. 5.7 > Why premiums change Premiums for health insurance tend to increase every year, regardless of which health insurance company you use. Why do my premium(s) increase every year? There are a number of reasons why the cost of your healthcare insurance could increase. We review premiums each year and make calculations based on a number of factors. Two of the more common reasons are because: • Your premium(s) will tend to rise as you get older. This is because, unfortunately, as we get older we all tend to suffer more health issues • The cost of medical treatment tends to rise too as new and better ways of diagnosing and treating diseases are developed. We regularly review our plans to keep them up to date and to include new tests and treatments where we can. Page 51 What happens if my premium(s) are to change? Your premium(s) will only change at renewal or if something changes, such as adding a new baby, during the year. We will tell you about any changes to your premium(s) in plenty of time. Is there anything I can do to reduce my premium(s)? There are a few things that you may be able to do to reduce your premium(s). For example you can: • add an excess, or set a higher excess • remove the dental upgrade or change your plan.
